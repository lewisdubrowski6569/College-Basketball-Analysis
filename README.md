## Description:
Simple analysis about NCAA Men's Basketball teams. So far, analysis includes data on player and team statistics in the regular season and the NCAA tournament, analysis on the number of players used per team in the regular season and the NCAA tournament, analysis of players' minutes played in the season and tournament, and graphs and plots that go along with the data analysis.
I plan to add more college basketball data and analysis in the future.
